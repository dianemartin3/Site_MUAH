This is a website I've made for a close relative. It is made on the excellent Photorama jekyll template (https://github.com/sunbliss/photorama) that I customised to the specific use of showcasing photos.

You may reuse the code however all the photos are submitted to author's rights. As such you can not reuse them without the explicit agreement of all the people involved in the making of this photos.

In a nutshell you may fork this project but you can not use the photos in it. Thanks for your comprehension.
